# Contour Detection and Simplification Tool

## Overview
This project provides an image processing pipeline designed to detect and simplify contours in images. It involves preprocessing images to enhance contrast and remove noise, detecting edges using the Prewitt operator, finding connected components, and simplifying these contours using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The result is a visualization of both raw and simplified contours that can aid in computer vision tasks such as object recognition, feature extraction, or shape analysis.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, enhances contrast using CLAHE, and removes shadows.
- **Edge Detection**: Implements the Prewitt operator for edge detection.
- **Contour Extraction**: Identifies connected pixel components to form contours.
- **Contour Simplification**: Uses the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce the number of points in contours while preserving their shape.
- **Visualization**: Displays images and detected contours using Matplotlib.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/contour-detection-tool.git
   cd contour-detection-tool
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Usage
1. **Load an Image**:
   Replace `photos/2.png` with your image path or modify the `input_image` variable accordingly.

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to preprocess the image, detect contours, and display visualizations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   The script will display:
   - The original image.
   - The preprocessed image.
   - The image with detected contours.
   - Visualizations of raw and simplified contours.

## Code Structure
- **`preprocess_image()`**: Prepares the image by converting it to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, enhancing contrast, and removing shadows.
- **`detect_edges_with_prewitt()`**: Applies the Prewitt operator for edge detection.
- **`find_connected_components()`**: Identifies groups of connected pixels to form contours.
- **`simplify_contour_douglas_peucker()`**: Simplifies detected contours to reduce data while maintaining shape.
- **`visualize_contours()`**: Plots the contours for easy inspection.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for color image processing.
- Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Deploy as a web application using `Flask` or `Streamlit`.
- Optimize performance with parallel processing or library optimizations.
